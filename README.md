Surveys app (I created this app for learn some new features)
<p>After registrations you can create survey, add questions and send this survey to anyone.</p>
<p>There is four type of questions: input, textarea, select, options.</p>
<p>And two tabs: dashboard and surveys</p>
<p>Dashboard shows information about surveys count, last answer, total answers and other</p>
<p>Surveys shows all surveys with pagination. You can select concrete survey and edit it(add message, questions, image, description), get link to answer or delete survey</p>
